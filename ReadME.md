This program is an interactive 3D web visualization of a spinnin sphere, encircled by five 
individually rotating rings. This is set against a pitch black background that mimics 
a star-filled night sky, created using numerous white dots against a dark canvas, 
enhancing the overall celestial theme.

this programs visually displays a 3D sphere that rotates continuously, serving as the focal point. 
Using Three.Js, surrounding this sphere are five rings, each rotating at its own unique pace, adding a layer of complexity and depth to the visual display. 
Users can click and drag to control the camera's view, exploring the sphere and rings from various angles. 
To enhance the user interaction, the program utilizes OrbitControls.js, a part of the Three.js library, allowing for intuitive camera control. 
When the user is not interacting with the scene, it continues to auto-rotates, ensuring the display remains dynamic and engaging
making it easy for users to engage with the 3D scene, offering a seamless and responsive experience.
